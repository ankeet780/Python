def Display_furniture_list(furniture_list):
    '''
This function is designed to display a list of furniture items in a tabular format, with clear headers and divider,
making it easy to read and understand the information about each furniture item in the list. Each item is displayed
with its ID, Manufacturer, Product name, Quantity, and Price.

# This is a function to update the furniture list after a transaction

def update_furniture_list(furniture_list, furniture_id, quantity, is_purchase):
    '''
The purpose of the update_furniture_list function is to handle the furniture store's inventory by adjusting the quantity
of a particular item in stock depending on whether it is a purchase or a sale. A list of furniture items, the specific
item's ID, the quantity to change, and a boolean to determine if it is a purchase are required for the update process.
The function iterates over the furniture list to locate the item that has the same ID. If the item is discovered during
a purchase operation, the stock quantity will be incremented by the specified amount. It verifies whether there is
sufficient stock to complete the sale; otherwise, it provides an error message. If there is sufficient inventory,
it will reduce the amount appropriately. If successful, the function will return the updated furniture item; otherwise,
it will return None if there is not enough stock or an invalid ID.

# Function to validate number input from the user
def get_valid_number(choice):
    '''
 The get_valid_number function ensures the user inputs a valid integer by continuously asking for input until an integer is given.
 In case of invalid input like a string or a non-integer number, the function detects the error, notifies the user of the issue,
 and asks for input once more. When a legitimate integer is inputted, the function will give back that integer, making sure that
 the program gets the appropriate input type for additional operations.

def get_valid_float(choice):

   The get_valid_float function ensures that the user provides a valid floating-point number by continuously prompting for input
   until a valid number is entered. If the user provides invalid input that cannot be converted to a float, the function catches
   the resulting error, informs the user of the mistake, and prompts them again. Once a valid floating-point number is entered,
   the function returns this number, ensuring the program receives the correct type of input for further calculations or processing.
